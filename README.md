The diagram code for each sequence diagram is numbered and labled in order based on Assignment 2's requirements/guidelines.
To check the code, go to planttext.com OR use plantuml.com's online editor to test the code. Either works fine and should produce the same diagrams with a few disparities.
If either website does not work or does not produce the same results, please contact me at ehdmhg@mst.edu so I can go to office hours to reproduce the results.
